## Dots and Boxes

### Game instructions
1. Two players take turns selecting an edge that connects two dots.
2. When a player completes the fourth edge of a 1x1 box, they earn one point and take another turn. The respective square will be shaded in the player-assigned color (P1 - Red, P2 - Blue). 
3. The game ends when all edges are taken, and the player with the most points wins. 
4. Press 'r' to restart.
5. The board size can be changed by modifying the DIM variable inside the main of dotsandboxes.py. Default is 3x3.
